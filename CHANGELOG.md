# Changelog

All notable changes to Spectacle 2 are documented here. This project adheres to
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [2.5.4] - 2026-08-11

One user-visible fix, in About, plus the DragonKit major that makes it impossible to regress.

### Fixed
- **About links the open-source licence notices.** The pane has listed `Sparkle → MIT` under
  Credits since 2.5.0 while `licensesURL` stayed nil, so it named a component the app bundles and
  gave no route to that component's licence text — the half of MIT's "included in all copies" that
  the hosted page exists to carry. The row now opens
  `https://www.dragonapp.com/spectacle-2/licenses/`. The trailing slash is the path GitHub Pages
  serves, so the link is the page and not a redirect to it.
  The defect was found by comparing all five Dragon apps' About panes side by side; Spectacle 2 and
  Dragon Sample App were the two that shipped the attribution without the link. DragonKit 4.0.0
  makes `licensesURL` non-optional, so no app can fall into it again by leaving a parameter out.

### Changed
- **DragonKit 3.4.0 → 4.0.0**, a breaking major. Two call-site changes here, both in
  `AboutConfig.swift`:
  - `licensesURL:` is now required, which is the fix above.
  - The upstream project's URL moved inside `OriginalWork`. It was a separate
    `originalProjectURL:` parameter, and nothing tied the two together: clipmenu-2 and ice-2 each
    passed the credit and omitted the URL, shipping a "Based on" row naming a project the pane
    linked nowhere. This app always passed both, so the `Original project` and `Based on` rows
    render exactly as they did in 2.5.3 — the change here is that they can no longer be supplied
    apart.

  About's "Built with · DragonKit v4.0.0" row is the only other thing this release changes on
  screen. Nothing else in 4.0.0 reaches this app.

## [2.5.3] - 2026-08-11

Maintenance only. A single commit separates this from 2.5.2 and the app behaves identically; the
one difference a user can observe is the kit version About reports.

### Changed
- **DragonKit 3.3.0 → 3.4.0.** CONFORMANCE §R10 requires the declared pin to be at least the
  newest `vX.Y.Z` tag in dragon-kit, so publishing v3.4.0 put this app in violation the moment it
  landed — the next PR here would have red-X'd on a rule break it did not introduce. Nothing in
  3.4.0 is adopted: it adds `LanguagePicker(languages:onChange:)` with both parameters defaulted,
  for an app translated into fewer languages than the kit ships. Spectacle 2 does call
  `LanguagePicker()` — in `GeneralPane.swift` — but with no arguments, so `languages:` takes its
  default of all seven kit locales, which is exactly right here because Spectacle 2 ships all
  seven itself. The picker renders identically to 2.5.2.
  The bump is for pin currency, not to take up an API. About's "Built with · DragonKit v3.4.0" row
  is the one user-visible consequence, which is why it is also the single What's New entry instead
  of notes padded out to look like a feature release.

## [2.5.2] - 2026-08-10

Maintenance only. Every fix below is in the local debug build that runs beside the installed
release; the shipped app behaves exactly as 2.5.1 did.

### Fixed
- **`scripts/run.sh` no longer writes `(Debug)` into `CFBundleShortVersionString`.**
  `MAC-APP-RELEASE-LIFECYCLE.md` makes that field the sole source of truth for the app's semantic
  version, and `release.yml` runs the shared workflow with `assert_tag_matches_plist: true`, so it
  is the exact string a `vX.Y.Z` tag is compared against — a channel label cannot live in it. The
  script now *asserts* the version is a numeric `X.Y.Z` candidate and fails loudly otherwise;
  clipmenu-2 and ice-2 had grown the same mutation, so it is a shape a debug script drifts back
  into. The word `Debug` moves to a `DragonBuildChannel` key, which DragonKit 3.3.0 renders as
  `v2.5.2 Debug (765) · …`, so a screenshot still identifies the build.

- **The debug build can no longer reach the production update feed.** Clearing
  `SUEnableAutomaticChecks` was never an off switch — `DragonUpdater` builds its `SPUUpdater`
  lazily, so the Updates pane armed Sparkle the moment it was opened and its toggle was live. The
  build script now deletes `SUFeedURL` from the debug bundle, which makes `try instance.start()`
  throw and leaves the updater nil, so the pane's toggle and button and the menu item all go inert
  at the data layer. The pane itself stays where it is — its position in the sidebar is DragonKit
  canon. The menu's "Check for Updates…" item is additionally withheld in a debug build by passing
  `onCheckForUpdates: nil`, the same mechanism a Mac App Store build uses, so it is absent rather
  than present-but-dead.

### Changed
- **DragonKit 3.2.0 → 3.3.0.** Adds `DragonAbout.buildChannel(bundle:)` and `isDebugBuild(bundle:)`
  and teaches `versionString()` to render the channel, which is what gives the `Debug` label
  somewhere to live outside the version field. About reports the kit version, so this is the one
  change in this release a user can see.

## [2.5.1] - 2026-08-10

### Changed
- **The DragonKit pin is now `from: "3.2.0"` instead of `exact: "3.2.0"`.** The Dragon apps had
  ended up stating the same intent three different ways; clipmenu-2 already wrote `from:`
  literally and ice-2's `.pbxproj` already spelled that range as `upToNextMajorVersion` with
  `minimumVersion 3.2.0`, leaving this app as the only one on `exact:`. No kit version moves here:
  3.2.0 is what 2.5.0 shipped against and 3.2.0 is now the floor.

  The change is not free, and the cost is specific to this repo. `Package.resolved` is gitignored
  here while the other two commit theirs, so they stay locked to a resolved revision and every CI
  build here re-resolves from scratch. Any 3.x kit tag published between now and the next release
  will therefore be built into that release without anyone having run the app against it. That is
  the accepted price of a single pin form across the family rather than an oversight — so a kit
  bump still wants a deliberate build-and-run check, against whichever version actually resolved,
  before a release tag goes out.

## [2.5.0] - 2026-08-08

### Added
- **`scripts/run.sh` stamps `DragonCommitDate` into the built bundle's `Info.plist`.** About's
  version line takes its timestamp from that key (`git log -1 --format=%cI`) instead of the
  executable's modification date, so both halves of `v2.4.2 (758) · 2026-Aug-08 04:04:06 UTC`
  now describe the same commit — rebuilding an old commit no longer moves the date while the
  build number holds. The release CI already stamps it via dragon-release-ci v5; without this
  a local build would silently show no timestamp at all, since `DragonAbout` deliberately has
  no fallback.

### Changed
- **DragonKit 2.4.0 → 3.0.1, and About moved to the kit's fixed-slot API.** `AboutContent` no
  longer accepts free-form `links` / `credits` arrays — five apps used them to ship five
  visibly different About panes — so this app now supplies only URLs and proper nouns while the
  kit owns every row title, SF Symbol and ordering. Three consequences here: the copyright is
  assembled by `DragonAbout.copyright(years:holder:)` rather than typed; the "Built with" row is
  emitted by the kit with its own version (`DragonKit v3.0.1`), so an app can neither omit it
  nor misreport which kit it compiled against; and Sparkle is now credited as an `Attribution`
  row. The six `app.about.*` keys the old hand-built rows needed are deleted from all seven
  languages, replaced by the kit's own `DragonKit.about.*`.

- **`AboutConfig` now matches the other Dragon apps exactly.** It called
  `DragonAbout.versionString()` through a private `versionString` wrapper that added nothing;
  clipmenu-2 and ice-2 pass the call straight into `AboutContent`, and only yahoo-keykey-2 wraps
  it (to append a Debug marker). The wrapper and its stale doc comment are gone. No behaviour
  change — the rendered string is identical.

### Fixed
- **The Website row opened the studio hub instead of this app's own page.** It pointed at
  `dragonapp.com` while `dragonapp.com/spectacle-2/` already existed. The kit now derives the
  row's detail text from the URL and checks the website path against the Support row's
  repository name, so the two rows verify each other and the bare hub is unrepresentable.
- **The Support row opened the repository root and was titled "Source".** It is now the issues
  page, titled "Support on GitHub" — the row every other Dragon app already showed.
- **Corrected the root cause recorded for 2.4.1 below.** The original entry claimed a
  "nineteen-minute race" in which `DragonAbout` did not yet exist when this app was scaffolded.
  That was wrong, and backwards: the helper was tagged in kit **v1.3.0 at 22:22:05** on
  2026-07-06 and this app was scaffolded at **22:40:41**, eighteen minutes *later*. Because
  `from: "1.2.1"` is a range (`>= 1.2.1, < 2.0.0`), it resolved to v1.3.0, so the helper was
  reachable from the very first build. See the corrected 2.4.1 entry.

## [2.4.1] - 2026-08-07

### Fixed
- **The About panel showed the version in the wrong format.** It read `2.4.0 (754)`, missing both
  the `v` prefix and the ` · <UTC build time>` suffix that every other Dragon app shows. It now
  reads `v2.4.1 (<build>) · <UTC build time>`.

  `AboutConfig` built the string by hand instead of calling `DragonAbout.versionString()`, which
  `docs/ADOPT-DRAGONKIT-PROMPT.md` and `docs/STARTING-A-NEW-APP.md` in the kit both require.

  The helper was available the whole time. Kit commit `fbc9ff8` added `DragonAbout` **and**
  documented it at 22:21:58 on 2026-07-06, tagged **v1.3.0** at 22:22:05. All three sibling apps
  adopted it within six minutes — ice-2 at 22:27:57, yahoo-keykey-2 at 22:28:02, clipmenu-2 at
  22:28:08. Spectacle 2 was then scaffolded at **22:40:41**, twelve minutes after that sweep
  finished, from a pre-sweep `AboutConfig` shape. So it was never missed by the sweep; it was
  created just after it, already out of date, and `from: "1.2.1"` resolved to v1.3.0 — meaning
  the helper was callable from this app's first build.

  It then survived five kit bumps (1.2.1 -> 2.0.0 -> 2.1.0 -> 2.3.0 -> 2.4.0) untouched, because
  nothing enforces it: `dragon-conformance.py` rules R1-R11 contain no check for the About version
  format, so every release passed conformance with the wrong string.

## [2.4.0] - 2026-08-07

Takes **DragonKit 2.4.0**. This is a currency bump, not a fix: conformance rule R10 requires the
declared pin to be at least the newest kit tag, and 2.4.0 was tagged the same day 2.3.0 shipped
here. Nothing in it repairs a defect this app had.

### Added
- **Hide, Hide Others and Show All in the Settings window's menu bar.** 2.3.0 gave that window a
  menu bar whose application menu held only Quit; the kit now fills in the three conventional
  commands above it. The Edit and Window menus are unchanged, and the menu-bar dropdown — which
  this app builds from `DragonAppMenu` — is untouched by the kit release.

### Changed
- DragonKit 2.3.0 -> 2.4.0 in `Package.swift`, still pinned with `exact:`.

The kit's headline change in 2.4.0 is a new `includeQuit:` parameter, which lets a system-managed
input method keep Quit ⌘Q out of its Settings menu bar. It does not apply here: Spectacle 2 is quit
by the user, so it takes the default and keeps Quit in both the Settings menu bar and the dropdown.
Recorded so this entry can't be read as adopting a behaviour the app doesn't use.

## [2.3.0] - 2026-08-07

Takes **DragonKit 2.3.0**, held back in 2.2.2 until it could be adopted deliberately. Every change
below comes from the kit rather than this app's own code, and all of it is user-visible — which is
why this is a minor bump rather than a patch.

### Added
- **The Settings window has a menu bar again.** An accessory app that promotes itself to `.regular`
  with no main menu shows an empty menu bar, which meant the Settings window had no ⌘W, no ⌘Q, and
  no Cut/Copy/Paste/Select All in any text field — including the search field in the Shortcuts
  pane. The kit now installs a minimal menu bar while the window is open. This was raised as a
  finding against 2.2.0 and deliberately fixed upstream rather than patched here, so that every
  Dragon app gets it.

### Fixed
- **Restoring a file that isn't a Spectacle 2 backup could erase your settings.** Backup
  deserialization accepted any property list, so an unrelated file passed validation and the
  restore then replaced the settings suite with nothing — while the pane relaunched the app as
  though it had succeeded. Both required keys are now checked, and a backup taken from a different
  app's suite is refused.
- **A failed uninstall reported success.** Moving the app to the Trash could fail *after* the
  settings teardown had already run; the error was discarded and the app quit claiming it was
  done, leaving it installed with its settings gone.
- **"Back Up Now" no longer writes duplicate snapshots.** If nothing changed since the newest
  backup, the pane says so instead of silently adding an identical file — ten redundant snapshots
  could previously push the last genuinely different one out of the retention window.
- Backup file I/O moved off the main actor, so a backup folder on a slow network share no longer
  freezes the Settings window, and the Permissions pane stopped rebuilding its entire view and
  polling TCC once a second forever.

### Removed
- **The "back up automatically on quit" toggle.** Nothing in the kit or in any app ever read the
  preference it wrote. It shipped on by default and did nothing, while telling users their
  settings were being backed up at quit. Existing installs keep a harmless orphaned key.

### Changed
- Permission status no longer refreshes while the app is in the background; it refreshes the
  moment the app becomes active.
- The kit's own permission titles and descriptions were hardcoded English that no app could
  translate. They are localized in all seven languages now, and the per-row delete button in
  Backup & Restore has a VoiceOver label naming the file instead of being one unlabelled trash
  icon among identical ones.

### Note on the settings-reset bug
DragonKit 2.2.0's headline fix — synthesized `Decodable` not falling back to a property's default
for a missing key, resetting every preference on upgrade — **did not affect Spectacle 2**. This
app's `AppSettings` has always used a hand-written tolerant decoder that supplies a default for
each absent field, and 2.2.1 added tests covering it. The kit's forward-migration is taken here
regardless, and it now preserves a stored blob it genuinely cannot read rather than dropping it.

## [2.2.2] - 2026-08-07

**Nothing in this release changes how Spectacle 2 behaves.** It ships internal build-tooling
fixes and an explicit dependency pin. If you are on 2.2.1 there is no functional reason to
update.

### Changed
- The local development build now takes its display name from its own bundle rather than a
  hardcoded string, so a debug build no longer presents itself as the release build in the About
  panel, the Settings window title, or — the one that mattered — the Uninstall pane, whose
  optional-data path was resolving to the *release* build's `~/Library/Application Support`
  folder. In a release build this resolves to exactly the string it replaced, so the shipped app
  is unchanged.
- `scripts/run.sh` no longer quits an installed release copy every time it runs. Its process match
  was broad enough to hit `/Applications/Spectacle 2.app` as well as the debug build, because both
  bundles shipped an executable named `Spectacle2`. The debug bundle's executable is now named
  after the debug app, and the match is anchored to that bundle's own path.
- The debug build stamps its version as `X.Y.Z (Debug)`, so a screenshot or a bug report can't be
  mistaken for the release build.

### Internal
- DragonKit is now pinned to exactly `2.1.0` rather than floating with `from:`. `Package.resolved`
  is gitignored, so CI resolves dependencies from scratch on every build — a floating pin meant
  the next tag would silently ship whatever kit version happened to be newest at the time. Kit
  `2.2.0` is released and deliberately not taken in this release; it removes a Backup toggle and
  changes permission-refresh and uninstall behaviour, so it will get its own release once it has
  been tested hands-on. The kit's R10 conformance rule fails by design until then.

## [2.2.1] - 2026-08-06

A maintenance release. No new features — this is robustness and performance work on the
accessibility layer that every window action goes through, plus the first automated test coverage
for the app target.

### Fixed
- **An unresponsive app can no longer stall Spectacle 2.** Accessibility calls are synchronous
  cross-process IPC on the main thread, and they previously ran with the system default timeout, so
  a beachballing target application could hold up Spectacle 2's own menu bar and Settings window.
  All accessibility messaging is now bounded by an explicit 1-second timeout: past that, the action
  is a no-op instead of a freeze.
- **A misbehaving application can no longer crash Spectacle 2.** Values returned by the
  accessibility API were force-cast to the expected type. They now have their `CFTypeID` verified
  first, and an unexpected type makes the action a no-op.
- Removed a latent use-after-free in the global hot-key registration: the Carbon event handler held
  an unretained pointer to its manager and was never uninstalled. Not reachable in 2.2.0, since
  registration happens exactly once, but the guard is now in place.

### Changed
- **Drag-to-edge snapping no longer queries the dragged window on every mouse movement.** The frame
  read is only needed to tell a move from a resize when the drag arms, so once a drag is armed the
  snap path makes no accessibility calls at all.
- **Undo history is now capped at 50 positions per window** (previously one entry per move, kept
  for as long as the app ran). Anything older than the last 50 moves of a given window is no longer
  reachable with ⌥⌘Z — a deliberate trade for bounded memory in an app that stays resident.
- Drag-snap's pre-snap size memory is capped at 32 windows, evicting the oldest, so windows that
  were snapped and then closed no longer accumulate.

### Internal
- First tests for the `Spectacle2` app target: the persisted-settings migration decoder and the
  shortcut-store defaults merge, each against its own throwaway `UserDefaults` suite.
- The drag-snap zone-to-target decision moved into `SpectacleCore` as a pure function so it can be
  tested without a display. Test suite is 74 → 90.
- Documented in the README why Spectacle 2 ships without the App Sandbox: a sandboxed process
  cannot reach another application's windows through the accessibility APIs.

## [2.2.0] - 2026-08-04

Menu-bar dropdown changes inherited from **DragonKit 2.0**: every item now leads with an SF
Symbol, and **Uninstall** is gone from the menu — it lives in Settings.

### Added
- **Menu-bar icons** — every item in the dropdown now leads with an SF Symbol: About
  (`info.circle`), Check for Updates (`arrow.down.circle`), Settings (`gearshape`) and Quit
  (`power`). Supplied by the shared `DragonAppMenu`, so every Dragon app matches.

### Removed
- **Uninstall is no longer in the menu-bar dropdown**, where it sat one slip away from Quit. As a
  rare, destructive action it now lives only in Settings, as the last pane — which already
  confirms before removing anything and is otherwise unchanged.

### Changed
- DragonKit dependency `1.4.0` → `2.0.0`; the resolved 2.0.1 also makes **Cancel** the default
  button in the Uninstall pane, so Return lands on the safe choice.

## [2.1.0] - 2026-07-11

Rectangle-parity **drag-to-edge snapping**, configurable **window gaps**, and **startup
deferral**.

### Added
- **Window gaps** — a single configurable gap (points, default `0` = unchanged) applied as an
  outer screen-edge margin *and* between adjacent tiled windows, for halves, corners, thirds and
  fullscreen. `Center` and `Make Larger/Smaller` are unaffected. Includes a `Skip gap at the top
  edge` option. Exposed in the General settings pane and localized in all 7 languages.
- **Drag-to-edge snapping** — drag a window to a screen edge or corner to snap it, matching
  Rectangle's default behavior: top edge → maximize, corners → quarters, left/right edges →
  halves (top/bottom half within 145 pt of a corner), bottom edge → thirds with drag-toward-center
  two-thirds promotion. Includes a translucent footprint preview, undo support (drag-snaps record
  into the same history as keyboard actions), and unsnap-restore (grabbing a snapped window
  restores its pre-snap size under the cursor). Toggle in the General pane.
- Drag-snap honors the configured window gap; keyboard and drag-snap produce identical gapped
  frames for the same target.

### Changed
- **Startup deferral** — the 18 global hot-key registrations and the login-item (`SMAppService`)
  reconcile now run after the first runloop tick instead of blocking
  `applicationDidFinishLaunching`. No observable behavior change.
- `AppSettings` now uses a migration-safe custom decoder so existing users' stored preferences
  (`launchAtLogin`, `showInMenuBar`) survive the addition of the new gap/snap settings fields.

### Tests & coverage
`SpectacleCore` unit tests grew from **51 to 74** (+23), all passing. The parity-critical geometry
is fully unit-tested; the AppKit/AX/Carbon glue (drag monitors, footprint overlay, AX
under-cursor lookup, settings UI, startup ordering) is not headlessly testable and is verified by
`swift build` + the owner GUI e2e checklist in
`docs/superpowers/plans/2026-07-10-drag-snap-gaps-startup.md`.

- **`Tests/SpectacleCoreTests/GapTests.swift` (+9)** — window-gap math:
  - `gapInsetZeroIsIdentity`, `gapInsetShrinksAllEdgesByHalf`, `gapInsetSkipTopLeavesTopEdge` —
    the `WindowGap.inset` helper, including the Cocoa top-edge (`maxY`) skip case.
  - `gapZeroMatchesUngapped` — regression guard that `gap = 0` reproduces pre-existing results.
  - `gapLeftHalfHasOuterAndInnerGap` — full gap `G` at the outer edge *and* between two halves.
  - `gapFullscreenLeavesUniformMargin` — fullscreen gets a uniform full-`G` margin (consistent
    with a half-window's outer edge).
  - `gapDoesNotAffectCenter` — `Center` preserves size/position regardless of gap.
  - `gapCyclingStillAdvances` — the ½→⅔→⅓ repeat-press cycling still advances with a non-zero gap.
  - `gapSkipTopEdgeOnFullscreen` — `Skip gap at the top edge` removes only the top margin.
- **`Tests/SpectacleCoreTests/SnapGeometryTests.swift` (+14)** — drag-snap geometry:
  - Snap-target rects: `snapLeftHalfNoGap`, `snapMaximizeNoGap`, `snapTopLeftQuarterNoGap`,
    `snapThirdsPartitionTheWidth`, `snapTwoThirdsSpanTwoColumns`, `snapAppliesGap` (gap-aware,
    Cocoa bottom-left coordinates).
  - Cursor→zone classification (Rectangle constants — 5 pt edge, 20 pt corner, 145 pt short-edge):
    `zoneNilInInterior`, `zoneTopEdge`, `zoneBottomEdge`, `zoneLeftEdge`, `zoneCornerTopLeftWins`,
    `zoneCornerBottomRight` (corners win over edges), `sideHalfNearTopCorner`,
    `bottomEdgeThirdByCursorX`.
