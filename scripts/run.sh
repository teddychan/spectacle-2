# Spectacle 2 — local debug build. Per the dragon-mac-ops convention the debug build gets its
# OWN identity ("Spectacle 2 Debug" / a .debug bundle id) so its TCC (Accessibility) grant and
# settings never collide with an installed release copy (brew install --cask ...).
APP_NAME="Spectacle 2 Debug"
BIN_NAME="Spectacle2"                 # SwiftPM product name (what `swift build` produces)
# The executable *inside* the bundle is renamed to match the app, so Activity Monitor, `ps`, and
# the pkill below can tell this build apart from the installed release copy — both used to be
# called "Spectacle2", which meant this script's pkill also killed the user's release app.
EXEC_NAME="Spectacle 2 Debug"
DEBUG_ID="com.dragonapp.spectacle-2.debug"
# A stable self-signed identity of this exact name (Keychain Access → Certificate Assistant →
# Create a Certificate → type "Code Signing") makes the Accessibility grant persist across
# rebuilds. Without it we fall back to ad-hoc, which re-prompts each build.
SIGN_IDENTITY="Spectacle 2 Debug"
# Where the bundle inputs are READ from. DragonKit CONFORMANCE §R16 puts Info.plist and
# AppIcon.icns in App/ at the repo root — capital A, in every Dragon app whatever builds it —
# while Package.swift stays here, so `cd`-ing to the repo root is no longer enough to find them.
# One variable rather than the path repeated at each read: the two files moved together and the
# next thing §R16 adds (an entitlements file) will be read from the same place. release.yml
# passes the same directory to dragon-release-ci as swiftpm_bundle_inputs_directory, so the
# debug bundle and the released one are assembled from exactly these files.
